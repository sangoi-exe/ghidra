# Local fork changelog

## Unreleased — extension placement correction

- Version the validated legacy-toolchain extension under `extensions/ghidra-legacy-toolchains/` in this fork instead of requiring a separate repository.

- Add its native standalone Gradle settings boundary, retaining the module/project identity without changing the parent Ghidra build.

- Preserve validated runtime/source bytes and provide current module usage/validation guidance. Native build, source ownership and runtime-payload comparisons pass; prior behavior evidence is reused only for identical payload.

- Completion Code Gate and Closeout remain pending. No remote push or deletion of the historical source repository has occurred.
